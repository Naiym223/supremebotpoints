# Level System NO SQL.


This is a level system with a leaderboard that uses NO SQL.
It uses [this EDITED version of a mod](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/503191988821164032/507566692512169994/member_data_list_MOD.js)

You can set custom roles for each milestone (5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40 and 50) with the setrole cmd.
If no role is set, it wont give the role when reaching it.

XP needed per level is `current-level * 36`
Example: `8 * 36` = 288 xp

The leaderboard itself displays the top 10 users.
**ALL FILES ARE COMMANDS.**
